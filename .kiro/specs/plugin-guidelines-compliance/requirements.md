# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the compliance issues identified in the Obsidian Plugin Guidelines review for the Joplin Portal plugin. The plugin currently scores 95/100 for compliance but has several issues that must be resolved before release to ensure it meets Obsidian's standards and doesn't conflict with core functionality or other plugins.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Default Hotkey Conflicts

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want the Joplin Portal plugin to not override my existing keyboard shortcuts, so that I can continue using Obsidian's core functionality without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is installed THEN it SHALL NOT define any default hotkeys for commands
2. WHEN users want to assign hotkeys THEN they SHALL be able to do so through Obsidian's standard hotkey settings
3. WHEN the plugin loads THEN it SHALL NOT conflict with Ctrl+F (global search), Ctrl+A (select all), or Ctrl+Enter shortcuts
4. WHEN examining the command definitions THEN they SHALL NOT contain any `hotkeys` property

### Requirement 2: Remove Production Console Logging

**User Story:** As an Obsidian user, I want a clean developer console experience, so that debug messages from plugins don't clutter my console or impact performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin runs in production mode THEN it SHALL NOT output debug console.log statements
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN console logging SHALL be available for troubleshooting
3. WHEN the plugin encounters errors THEN it SHALL still log critical errors for debugging
4. WHEN examining the codebase THEN debug console statements SHALL be conditional or removed

### Requirement 3: Enhance URL Validation

**User Story:** As a user configuring the Joplin Portal plugin, I want clear validation feedback on my server URL, so that I can quickly identify and fix configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering a server URL THEN the system SHALL validate it uses http:// or https:// protocol
2. WHEN an invalid URL format is entered THEN the system SHALL show a clear error message
3. WHEN the URL validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on the correct format
4. WHEN a valid URL is entered THEN the system SHALL accept it without errors

### Requirement 4: Improve Error Message Specificity

**User Story:** As a user experiencing issues with the Joplin Portal plugin, I want specific error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a connection fails THEN the system SHALL differentiate between network, authentication, and server errors
2. WHEN an API request fails THEN the error message SHALL include context about the specific failure
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL specifically mention checking the API token
4. WHEN the server is unreachable THEN the system SHALL mention checking if Joplin is running

### Requirement 5: Add Debug Mode Setting

**User Story:** As a developer or advanced user, I want the ability to enable debug logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues when needed without affecting normal users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the plugin THEN there SHALL be a debug mode toggle in settings
2. WHEN debug mode is enabled THEN detailed logging SHALL be available in the console
3. WHEN debug mode is disabled THEN console logging SHALL be minimal or absent
4. WHEN debug mode is toggled THEN the change SHALL take effect immediately
