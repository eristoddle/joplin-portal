# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Joplin Portal plugin currently has a messy icon registration implementation with duplicate functions (`registerJoplinIcon()` and `registerJoplinIconEarly()`), multiple redundant calls throughout the onload process, unnecessary persistence checks, and debug commands that violate Obsidian plugin best practices. This feature will clean up the icon registration to follow the official Obsidian documentation and sample plugin patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want the icon registration to follow Obsidian's official documentation and best practices, so that the code is maintainable and follows standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN the system SHALL register the Joplin icon using the standard `addIcon()` function exactly once
2. WHEN the icon is registered THEN the system SHALL use the proper import statement from 'obsidian' module
3. WHEN the plugin code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL have no duplicate icon registration functions
4. WHEN the plugin loads THEN the system SHALL NOT have multiple calls to register the same icon

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a plugin user, I want the ribbon icon to display correctly without any registration issues, so that I can access the Joplin Portal functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin is loaded THEN the system SHALL display the Joplin icon in the ribbon
2. WHEN the ribbon icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the Joplin Portal view
3. WHEN the plugin is unloaded and reloaded THEN the system SHALL continue to display the icon correctly
4. WHEN the icon registration fails THEN the system SHALL log appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a plugin developer, I want to remove all unnecessary debugging and persistence code related to icon registration, so that the codebase is clean and follows the principle of simplicity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain `registerJoplinIconEarly()` function
2. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain `setupIconPersistenceCheck()` function
3. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain debug commands for icon status
4. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain periodic icon re-registration intervals
5. WHEN the code is reviewed THEN the system SHALL NOT contain multiple fallback methods for icon registration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a plugin maintainer, I want the icon registration to be simple and follow the single responsibility principle, so that future maintenance is straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plugin loads THEN the system SHALL register the icon in a single, dedicated function
2. WHEN the icon registration function is called THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with proper logging
3. WHEN the plugin architecture is reviewed THEN the system SHALL have icon registration separated from other initialization logic
4. WHEN the icon SVG is defined THEN the system SHALL use a clean, readable format without unnecessary complexity
