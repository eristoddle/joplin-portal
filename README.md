## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**"Cannot connect to Joplin server"**
- Verify Joplin desktop app is running (if using local server)
- Check that Web Clipper service is enabled in Joplin
- Ensure the server URL is correct (usually `http://localhost:41184`)
- Verify your API token is valid

**"Unauthorized" errors**
- Double-check your API token
- Regenerate the token in Joplin if needed
- Ensure there are no extra spaces in the token

### Import Issues

**"File already exists"**
- Choose a conflict resolution option (Skip, Overwrite, or Rename)
- Consider organizing imports into dated folders

**"Permission denied"**
- Check that Obsidian has write permissions to your vault
- Ensure the target folder path is valid

### Performance Issues

**Slow search results**
- Reduce the search limit in settings
- Use more specific search terms
- Check your Joplin server performance

### Debug Mode

**When to enable debug mode**
- Enable debug mode in plugin settings when troubleshooting issues
- Debug mode provides detailed console logging for developers and advanced users
- **Warning**: Debug mode may expose sensitive information in console logs
- Always disable debug mode in normal usage to keep console clean

## Privacy & Security
