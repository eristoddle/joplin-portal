**"Unauthorized" errors**
- Double-check your API token
- Regenerate the token in Joplin if needed
- Ensure there are no extra spaces in the token

**"File already exists"**
- Choose a conflict resolution option (Skip, Overwrite, or Rename)
- Consider organizing imports into dated folders

**"Permission denied"**
- Check that Obsidian has write permissions to your vault
- Ensure the target folder path is valid

### Performance Issues

**Slow search results**
